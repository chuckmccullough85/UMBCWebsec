# Flask AppSensor Implementation

This project implements a simple version of the AppSensor framework using Flask. It is designed to detect and respond to potential security threats in web applications.

## Project Structure

- **app.py**: Entry point of the Flask application, setting up routes and handling requests.
- **appsensor/**: Contains the core logic for the AppSensor framework.
  - **__init__.py**: Initializes the appsensor package.
  - **detector.py**: Implements detection logic for analyzing events.
  - **event.py**: Defines the structure of events with properties like event type and timestamp.
  - **response.py**: Contains response logic for handling detected events.
- **templates/**: Holds HTML templates for rendering web pages.
  - **base.html**: Base template with common layout elements.
  - **index.html**: Main template for the application.
- **static/**: Contains static files such as CSS and JavaScript.
  - **css/style.css**: Styles for the application.
  - **js/app.js**: Client-side JavaScript code.
- **notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with sample events and analysis.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd chapter9
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
