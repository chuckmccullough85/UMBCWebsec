# Core Security Principles Mastered

## **The Security Fundamentals:**

### **1. Never Trust User Input**
- Always validate, sanitize, and verify
- Implement input validation at multiple layers
- Use allowlists over denylists when possible

### **2. Implement Defense in Depth**
- Multiple independent security layers
- Fail securely when systems break
- Assume components will be compromised

---

### **3. Principle of Least Privilege**
- Minimal required permissions only
- Regular privilege review and cleanup
- Separate processes and accounts

### **4. Security by Design**
- Build security into the architecture
- Consider threats during design phase
- Make security the default behavior
